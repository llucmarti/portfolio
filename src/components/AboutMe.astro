      Hey! I'm Lluc 👋 I'm a software engineer based in Madrid, with a passion for building clean, scalable backend systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, I’m working at Zaleos, where I get to design backend services, lead internal projects, and help other engineers grow through mentoring and code reviews. I also run the Zaleos Academy, mentoring interns and helping them transition into full-time devs (which is super rewarding! 🌱✨.). 
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, you’ll probably find me training for a marathon 🏃‍♂️🏅, playing chess ♟️ or planning my next travel adventure ✈️🌍. Always curious. Always learning. 
    </p>
